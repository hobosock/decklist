export missing cards to text file in the correct format
store collection file location in config file
download new database file if current one is out of date
show error message on Deck tab if user tries to load an incompatible file
make misspelled cards check async
make terminal background opaque

Scryfall database check:
- download file, learn file name convention
  - names have the format "oracle-cards-yyyymmddhhmmss.json"
  - kind of guessing on the time thing but it doesn't matter
- check for file fitting generic name in data directory
  - std::fs::read_dir()
  - .is_file()
- if found, parse date from file name
  - already done
- get current date
- compare dates
- compare difference to database age limit from config
- REST request from Scryfall if too old
  - reqwest
